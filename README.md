An erstwhile Physics student who completed Master's in it but grew out of interest with the subject and hence didn't pursue PhD or anything else in that path. As I was exploring life, I got interested in Data Science and Analytics, specially after I pursued a 6 months of internship from a company. Then coming under the supervision and mentorship of Tech leaders like Vishwa Mohan, my interest grew further in Data Science, so much so that I decided to do a Master's in it.

My analytical skills that developed while studying Physics are helping me here as well after all both come under the umbrella of Science. So far so good. Currently in the final year of my 2nd Master's, I am having an internship experience of 1.2 years from 3 different companies covering domains like Health Economics and Outcomes Research, EdTech and research in renowned corporate institutes.

Also, in the meantime I participated and won a Hackathon. Thanks to my classmates, teachers, ChatGPT and the innumerable number of educators and professionals helping students for free on YouTube. As is evident from my academic background with the kind of ancillary subjects I've had, I have a varied exposure to many different branches of Science - Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Statistics, Data Science. Such a unique combination of subjects are not usually found in any random student.

I love exploring what a dataset wants to say through the Python and R language. I love exploring questions that business organizations are interested in for optimizing their profits.

# Key skills : 
* Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing
* Machine Learning Algorithms (Supervised & Unsupervised) 
* Data Interpretation and Storytelling
* Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
* Python and SQL

My teachers acknowledge that my presentation skills are good. Also, I like working both in a team (if all are excited about the project and are on the same page, otherwise its difficult motivating people who are not self motivated) and also as a lone wolf (as in the words of Tagore "If they answer not to thy call, walk alone"). I've an immense interest in any medium that deals with story-telling be it cinema, books, audio story, music or even Data Story telling as required in my professional side. 

And if you've read this much, certainly you find my background interesting. If you are a recruiter, I would be looking forward to work in a background-compatible role which you might have for me and which values me correctly in the market.
